# Alpha-Beta-Checkers-Game
# Checkers AI Agent

This project implements an AI agent using the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for playing the game of checkers. The AI agent is capable of making intelligent decisions based on an evaluation function and can provide a challenging opponent to human players.

## Project Idea

The main objective of this project is to develop an AI agent that can play the game of checkers at different difficulty levels. The agent uses the minimax algorithm, a recursive search algorithm, to explore the game tree and make optimal moves. Additionally, alpha-beta pruning is employed to improve the algorithm's efficiency by reducing unnecessary search paths.

The project involves creating a checkers board representation, implementing the rules and logic of the game, and designing an evaluation function that assigns scores to different game states. The AI agent then uses the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to evaluate and select the best moves based on the current game state.

## Features

- Checkers game implementation with a graphical user interface.
- AI agent using the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for decision-making.
- Adjustable difficulty levels to control the depth of search and decision-making of the AI.
- Evaluation function that takes into account factors such as piece count, board control, and positional advantage.
- Interactive gameplay allowing human players to play against the AI agent.
- Display of game state, current player, and move suggestions from the AI agent.


## Getting Started

To run the checkers game with the AI agent, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/llnr-19/alpha-beta-checkers-game.git`
2. Install the dependencies: `pip install pygame`
3. Run the main Python file: `python main.py`
4. Enjoy playing against the AI agent!
